# CHR Referral Tracking System

### Project Overview:
##### The CHR Referral Tracking System is a comprehensive and user-friendly application created to expedite the referral process for Community Health Representatives (CHRs) from different tribes. CHRs frequently need to refer clients to other healthcare practitioners or services for specialized treatment as part of their responsibility in delivering healthcare services to their communities. The CHR Referral Tracking System allows CHRs to handle and track referrals in an effective and structured manner, providing timely and appropriate assistanceÂ for their customers.

##### The system provides two versions for tracking referrals, giving flexibility based on the needs and infrastructure of an organization. The first version is the Google Cloud version, which uses the Google Drive environment for safe referral data storage. This version has the benefit of being easily accessible from anywhere, on any device with internet connection. It also includes extensive data management tools, including as real-time updates and team collaboration, to improve efficiency and coordination across CHRs.

#### Non-Cloud Version: [link](https://github.com/CANIS-NAU/CHR_Data/tree/main/Non-cloud%20Version)
##### The non-cloud referral tracking system, which is often hosted on a local server, is the second version. This version is appropriate for entities with particular needs or data privacy concerns due to its benefit of total data ownership and system flexibility. It may be used in distant or offline contexts since it can be accessed without an internet connection. Additionally, this version allows for customization and system integration with other nearby networks.

### Conclusion:

The system makes it simple for CHRs to keep track of referrals, check on their progress, and produce data for tracking and analysis. It offers a unified and effective platform for managing referrals, easing administrative work, strengthening provider communication, and ultimately raising the standard of care for patients.

The CHR Referral Tracking System is a dependable and effective method for tracking referrals in a healthcare context because to its user-friendly interface, powerful data management tools, and compliance with HIPAA requirements.
